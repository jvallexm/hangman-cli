# Hangman-Cli

It's hangman! But on the command line! 

And all the words are the titles of episodes of the NBC comedy 30 Rock!

## Getting Started

Just clone the repo, install the [inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) package and you're good to go!

## Running the App

Just one line--nothing too fancy!

```
node hangman-cli
```
